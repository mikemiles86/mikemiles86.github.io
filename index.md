I am a technical leader and developer working in the web development space since 2003.  A majority of my career has been spent working in an agency setting, leading and working on teams to architect robust web experiences for customers large and small. 

I am currently the Director of Web Development for [MIT Sloan](https://mitsloan.mit.edu) where I lead the development, maintenance and growth of the public digital properties for the school, as well as, the development team that supports them.

I am a public speaker and present at technical conferences around the world. You can view recordings of my past talks and listing of my upcoming presentations on my [Talks](https://talks.mike-miles.com/) page.

I am also the host of the podcast [Developing Up](https://www.developingup.com); a podcast focused on the non-technical side of being a developer.
